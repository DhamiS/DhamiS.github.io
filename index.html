                <p>A little about myself…So I‘ve enrolled into the University of Toronto’s coding bootcamp in order to switch career paths and get into the Tech world. I am 26 years old and have a bachelor of commerce from the University of Toronto. I currently work at TD Canada Trust as a financial advisor.</p>

                <p>In my Free time I like to either be watching sports or playing sports. I currently play on two co-ed soccer teams and one men’s league team. Being a sports fanatics and being born in England I keep strong ties to my roots and following the English Premier League which is the top tier league within England, in which I religiously follow Manchester United football club. In addition to following Manchester United religiously I’ve collected every jersey they released dating from 1992 (the year I was born) too now.</p>
